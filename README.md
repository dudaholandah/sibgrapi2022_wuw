# SIBGRAPI WUW 2022

This repository was created to support the article Food Data Analysis using Multidimensional Visualizations based on Point Placement written by Maria Eduarda M. de Holanda and Vin√≠cius R. P. Borges.

Dataset
-------

The selected dataset can be found in [vegan_dataset](vegan_dataset.xlsx).

Results
-------

Four state-of-the-art and recent visualization techniques were considered in the proposed method: Principal Component Analysis (PCA); t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and TriMap. The implementation in Python can be found in [sibgrapi_visualizations.ipynb](sibgrapi_visualizations.ipynb).

In order to evaluate the quality of the selected visualization techniques, we followed two steps: 
- finding the best choices of hyperparameters in each method, that can be found in  [sibgrapi_hyperparameters.ipynb](sibgrapi_hyperparameters.ipynb).
- comparing the results with the previous mentioned evaluation metrics, which can be found in [sibgrapi_evaluation.ipynb](sibgrapi_evaluation.ipynb).
